# CEE-598---Extra-Credit
The following repository contains 4 notebooks with different examples seen in Lectures 6, 8 and 18 at CEE 598: Urban Transportation Models subject.

At Environmental Quality Standard Problems notebook, it is provided 3 examples that help to find:
1. The minimum environmental quality standard for a network with a certain demand given between Origin-Destination
2. The maximum demand that a network could achieve (without improvements) under certain environmental quality standard given 
3. The viability of a transportation network to achieve certain environmental standards. 

The Marginal Cost Pricing Toll notebook is divided into 2 examples:
1. The determination of the network flow distribution under Beckmann formulation for User Equilibrium 
2. The determination of the network flow distribution under System-Optimum Formulation
3. The determination of Marginal-cost pricing toll that leads the system to go from User Equilibrium to System Optimum performance.

Frank-Wolfe for UE and Frank-Wolfe for SO analyze a more complex network and do the same analysis as for Marginal Cost Pricing but in this case, it is implemented the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm for the assignment of flow to the links. 

This repository is designed to meet the criteria for completing the CEE 598 Extra Credit Assignment and includes at least 5 examples seen in lectures addressing issues in networking, traffic distribution, and environmental quality standards.
